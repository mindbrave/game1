    apply collision effects if collides - DONE
    if one entity collides with other type, but other type doesnt, then dont collide them - DONE
    does overlap, check if effect is applied
    if doesnt overlap, dont apply overlap effects
    case with high speed and two overlaping entities
    case with highspeed and collide and overlap that wont occur because of collision
    if collides, never apply overlap effects
    if doesnt collide but overlaps, apply overlap effect, and no collide
    few collision effects should stack (dont apply just last one)
    few overlap effects should stack (dont apply just last one)
